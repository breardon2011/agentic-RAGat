how to use Auxiliary flash. mean how to read or write api's..?

is there a limitation on write cycle..?

is this can be used for event log ..? 

is can we have file system like fat16,fat32, etc ..?

Topic: Secure OTA Firmware Upgrade - Application Versioning

Hi!

Thank you in advance.

I am trying to implement the application versioning info to my device ( AIROC CYW20719B2 chip).

Following the cypress doc for SOTA FW UPGRADE.
Secure Over-the-Air Firmware Upgrade (cypress.com)
as mentioned in section 6.1 for application versioning.

Couldn't store or update the app info,
1. Receiving compilation error when adding the piece of code as per doc sec6.1

error: unknown type name 'PLACE_IN_APP_ID_AREA'
   51 | PLACE_IN_APP_ID_AREA wiced_bt_application_id_t mighty_vibe_app_id =
      | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kindly provide me solution to fix this.

2. what and where exactly it means  PLACE_IN_APP_ID_AREA as per doc sec 6.1 ?
3. I used sdk api (wiced_firmware_upgrade_store_to_nv) to manually store 
the app info in nv address location.
4. Also I didn't find any handle/API that provides my application the Active DS address location to store the App info.

Need a fix asap to complete SOTA FW UPGRADE with app versioning information.

Thank you.

Answer is that the user is trying to use the wrong software example for the SDK they are using.

Topic: cybt-213043-02 not entering sleep mode

Hi,

I am using cybt-213043-02 eval board. I am running https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btsdk-low-power-20819 example with a tweak that changes the eval board to cybt-213043-eval.

I can see the output on the PUART when I press the user button and the ble works ok.

However the board never enters sleep mode. I see a constant ~2.5mA usage and the sleep permit handler is never called. Also sleep callback is never called.

The HOST_WAKE and DEV_WAKE pins are floating. I have tried tying them to either VCC or GND without effect. Is there some additional configuration or hw requirement to trigger sleep mode.

Thank you for response.

Moderator answer:

Hi @zrelieskim,
The issue with CYBT-213043-02 not entering sleep mode is a known issue which is being taken care of internally. It will be fixed in the upcoming release.

For time being, please downgrade the 20819A1 LowPower Library using the library manager from 4.4.2 release to 4.2.1. This will fix the problem.

As far as your query on DEV_WAKE pin is concerned, DEV_WAKE and HOST_WAKE pins are Arm® GPIOs available in CYW20819. They are different as compared to other available LHL GPIOs.

Arm® GPIOs can operate only in active mode and they do not support muxable peripherals. They do not operate in Sleep mode.

This is the reason why you have not been able to wake up the device from sleep state using the DEV_WAKE.

You may refer this document on CYW20819/CYW20820 feature and peripheral guide for better clarity.

I request you to change your GPIO pin requirement.

Thank you.

Regards,
Sanketh B Prabhu

The repo is
https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btsdk-low-power-20819



Analysis:

The file in the repo,
https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btsdk-low-power-20819/blob/master/low_power_20819.c

contains enough info that when provided as context for an LLM call, the LLM produces
an answer that mentions DEV_WAKE and HOST_WAKE pins on GPIOs.
The answer does not specifically mention that Arm® GPIOs can operate only in active mode and they do not support muxable peripherals. They do not operate in Sleep mode.


The pdf doc:
Infineon-AN226546_CYW20819_Feature_and_Peripheral_Guide-ApplicationNotes-v04_00-EN.pdf

has on Page 6:

Arm® GPIOs can operate only in active mode and they do not support muxable peripherals. DEV_WAKE,
HOST_WAKE, and four BT_GPIOs are the Arm GPIOs available in the CYW20819A1KFB1G package, whereas
DEV_WAKE and HOST_WAKE are the Arm GPIOs available in the CYW20819A1KFBG package. The DEV_WAKE
can be used to wake the Bluetooth® device with a signal from the host. The HOST_WAKE signal can be used
to wake the host device with a signal from the Bluetooth® device. BT_GPIOs can be configured as a GCI
(Global Co-existence Interface) pin.

Topic: Multi Counter Watch Dog Timer

Hello,

I'm trying to use the MCWDT as an interrupt source to wake my device from deep sleep every 30 minutes. The problem I have is I actually don't know how to configure it or even how the coding flow works for it. I've been looking around for an example of it but the only thing I can find it where it is used as a free running counter. Anyone here can tell me how to actually do it in modus toolbox?

Community Forum Developer question:
Group: Home/Forums/Sensors/3D Hall (Magnetic sensor)
Topic: Can any one share the calculation process of atan2, atan of hall sensor design

Hello,

I am using website tool of magnetic design tool to design a speed measurement system using 3D hall sensors.

I make one simulation based on the website tool.

I get result, like Bx, Bz, distance, error. ..

When  i go to detail calculation process, using Bx, Bz, Atan(Bx/Bz according to application notes), while i can't get same result as showed by website tool.

Any one can make an explanation of the website calculation process ?

Another point, we want to make DOE analysis, if the hall sensor has some mis-alignment, or mis-orentation. So, we need to do a lot of calculation loops, in this way the website calculation is not convenient.

Is ti possible to share us formula, how you calculate Bx, By, Bz from permanent in your website tool, so we can make DOE calculation in excel, or in your other tools.

For website tool, it is impossible to do DOE, or parameter sensitive analysis, you need to input parameter one by one, and record result, it is very time consuming.

Thanks.

Topic: Prevent automatic re-connection with a bonded device

I am using a CYBLE-022001-00 chip, and I have made use of the bonding feature of the BLE so that I will only pair with a device once. I am well aware that enabling bonding means that automatic reconnection is inevitable.

Is there a way to bond with a SELECTED bonded device and prevent re-connection with a "not-selected" bonded device? thanks.

Community Forum Developer question:
Group: Home/Forums/Microcontrollers/Multiple CAN BUS
Topic: Multiple CAN BUS / Abstraction Layer Strategies XMC7000 Series

Hello all!

I am working on a project with an XMC7100 series MCU.

My project is making use of multiple CAN busses and I am trying to figure out the best way to encapsulate each CAN bus code into a resuable module so I can write a common set of functions to do things like initialization, send and received messages.

However, the CAN bus example found here and the autogenerated code from Modustoolbox both rely on a lot of globally named variables which make it challenging to figure out how to move into an abstraction layer. Ideally I would like to put each CAN bus into a CAN bus class in C++, though happy to use functions / structs in C as long as they are written in a resuable fashion.

Has anyone else attempted this and/or does the Infineon team have any advice or samples I could start from?

How does the moderator know this?  Did they spend a lot of time looking?
Did they know how the code and examples are organized, so they know the right place to look?
How can an AI assisted repo search and indexing solution know to return a negative example,
that the document someone is looking for does not exist?
